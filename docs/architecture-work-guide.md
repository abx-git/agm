# Architecture Work — Guide

Use the compiled Blueprint graph to **answer questions**, run **analyses**, and produce **designs** — without rescanning the entire codebase. Results are stored as Markdown in `docs/architecture/work/` and registered in `blueprint.md`.

This phase requires a completed or partially completed Bootstrap (arc42 sections and interface contracts exist). On large core systems, keep investing in **Refinement** in parallel — Architecture Work is most reliable when the underlying graph stays current.

For **base context**, **roles** (`[SA:*]` prompts), **semantic anchors**, **templates**, **compaction**, **review**, and **ops/** see [Extensions](./blueprint-pattern-extensions.md) and [PROMPT.md](./PROMPT.md#1-system-prompt).

**Templates:** arc42 is optional — `arc42` · `c4-light` · `adr-first` · `lean-service` · `custom`. Record choice in `entry-point.md`.

## When to use

| Situation | Mode | Output |
|-----------|------|--------|
| *"How does X connect to Y?"* | **Query** | Answer with traceable links |
| *"What are the risks of our payment integration?"* | **Analysis** | Structured findings |
| *"Design circuit breaker for payment calls"* | **Design** | Proposal + optional ADR draft |

Activate a workflow: [architecture-work-query](./prompts/workflows/architecture-work-query.md) · [analysis](./prompts/workflows/architecture-work-analysis.md) · [design](./prompts/workflows/architecture-work-design.md) — see [prompts/README.md](./prompts/README.md). Role steps: [role-architecture-work.md](./templates/architecture/prompts/role-architecture-work.md).

### File naming

- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-<short-slug>.md` (e.g. `2026-05-31-payment-circuit-breaker-design.md`)
- Reviews: `YYYY-MM-DD-review-<slug>.md`
- Slug: lowercase, hyphens, max ~50 characters
- One topic per file; supersede old items by setting status `superseded` and linking to the replacement

### Work item ID

Register each file in `blueprint.md` under `## Architecture work` with ID `WRK-NNN` (sequential per application).

---

## Work item types

| Type | Purpose | Typical sections used |
|------|---------|------------------------|
| `question` | Answer a specific architecture question | Context, Answer, Traceability |
| `analysis` | Evaluate structure, risks, quality, coupling | Context, Findings, Recommendations |
| `design` | Propose a target architecture or change | Context, Design, Alternatives, Impact, ADR link |

---

## Rules for agents

1. **Read** `context/always-on.md` → `blueprint.md` → `entry-point.md` — then traverse only via Markdown links.
2. **Load** `prompts/role-architecture-work.md`; output `[[ANCHOR:WORK_ITEM]]`, `[[ANCHOR:LINK_CHECK]]`.
3. **Do not duplicate** arc42 or interface contract content — link to it.
4. **Every claim** must appear in the Traceability table with a link to source (arc42 file, `exports.md`, `ops/`, or source file).
5. **Write output** to `docs/architecture/work/` and **update** `blueprint.md` before stopping.
6. If a design implies an architectural decision, **draft an ADR** in `arc42/decisions/` and cross-link.
7. Run referential integrity check on all new links.
8. **Compaction:** after long sessions, follow [PROMPT.md § Compaction](../PROMPT.md#1-system-prompt) and update the session log with a resume prompt.

## Review (separate from Architecture Work)

**Review** verifies documentation in a **fresh session** using `role-review.md`. It does not replace Architecture Work.

| Review type | When |
|-------------|------|
| Phase | After each arc42 phase |
| Milestone | After Bootstrap |
| Maintenance | After a maintenance run |
| Periodic | Scheduled staleness check |

Output → `work/_template-review.md` format; register in `blueprint.md` → `## Reviews`.

See [PROMPT.md §5 Review prompts](../PROMPT.md#5-review-prompts).

---

## Relationship to other operations

| Operation | Architecture Work |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Bootstrap | Prerequisite — creates the graph to traverse |
| Refinement | Updates arc42 when documentation was thin; Work may trigger Refinement |
| Maintenance | Updates arc42 after code changes; Work does not replace Maintenance |
| Review | Retrospective verification; may reference Work outputs |
| ADR | Design work may produce ADR drafts for human review |

---

## Human review

Architecture Work outputs are **drafts for review**. The architect approves, rejects, or promotes findings into arc42, ADRs, or backlog items. Prefer the **Review** operation in a separate agent session for systematic verification.
